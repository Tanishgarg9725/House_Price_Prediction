# üè† House Price Prediction 

This project aims to build a regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The solution is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook and follows a data-driven, machine learning approach.


## üß† Model Pipeline

The main steps in `Model.ipynb` include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizations to understand distributions and correlations
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new features, transforming existing ones
4. **Model Training**  
   - Using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
5. **Evaluation**  
   - RMSE, MAE, and other metrics
6. **Prediction & Submission**  
   - Generating predictions for `test.csv` in submission format
